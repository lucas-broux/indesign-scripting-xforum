Here are different scripts I wrote for the automation of InDesign tasks :
  - Generation of badges.
  - Generation of a brochure.

To install and execute the scripts :
  - Copy/Paste the .js files in the Adobe Indesign installation folder (Adobe/InDesign/Scripts/Scripts Panel).
  - Edit the script and change the ** const link ** (among the first lines of the files) into the path of the working directory (e.g. \\..\\Scripting badges or \\..\\Scripting brochure).
  - In the InDesign software, open the Scripts panel and click on the script to execute.

Note that the scripts rely on the specific layer structure of the provided .indd files.
